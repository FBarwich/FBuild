This will be my own Build-System.

All the Build-Systems I found where Multi-Plattform, Multi-Compiler, 
Multi-Whatever.

I don't care for Linux or simplicity or other compilers than the one 
I use, wich is Visual C++. 

The "Makefile" is a lua script (http://www.lua.org)

I doubt it's of any use for anyone but me. Nevertheless I make this
public domain, because you never know...
